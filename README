rpmt-py - A transactional RPM (Python version)
==============================================


1. Presentation 
---------------

rpmt-py is a tool to install, upgrade and erase RPM packages in one transaction, 
thus allow package sets with complex dependencies to be processed at once while 
keeping the system in a consistent state.

There was a need for such a program, because the classic front-end to the RPM 
package manager (rpm) only allows one type of such action in a transaction.

rpmt-py is part of the Quattor administration toolkit, see http://quattor.org 
for more information about rpmt-py and Quattor.

rpmt-py is inspired on RedHat's rpm and based on rpm-python binding library 
(itself based on rpmlib).


2. Differences with the 'old' rpmt (ANSI/C version 4.2.1)
---------------------------------------------------------

- Input file (transaction actions) is now specified using -iFILE or --in=FILE.	

- Now the --oldpackage option is assumed for the whole transaction.

- The cache directory for downloading remote files can now be specified using
the --cachedir option. In addition, we can avoid the clean up of this directory
by using the --noclean option.
